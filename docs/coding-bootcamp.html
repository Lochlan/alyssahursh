		<h1>So You're Thinking About Going to a Coding Bootcamp</h1>

		<p>I really believe that anyone can become a software engineer if they want to. That doesn't mean it's easy! I've fielded dozens of coffee chats and phone calls with acquaintances who were considering doing a coding bootcamp. Here's the short version.</p>

		<p>This document was lasted updated on <b>20 MARCH 2022</b></p>

		<h2>Start with free online classes to gauge your interest</h2>

		<p>To get the most out of a bootcamp program, I strongly recommend taking a few online courses to prepare. I did two MITx classes before applying to <a href="https://adadevelopersacademy.org" target="blank">Ada Developers Academy</a>, and I think they were a big reason for my success. The "audit" track is free; I don't think there's a reason to pay for the "verified" version.</p>

		<h3>edX / MITx intro computer science courses:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7?index=product&queryID=d50e0ab5f084a134213064e197e913e2&position=2" target="blank">Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-4" target="blank">Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science</a></li>
		</ul>

		<p>You get as much out of these programs as you put into them, so put good work into them.</p>
		<p>If you have a hard time feeling engaged with the material, or if you find excuses to avoid doing the homework, this might not be the right path for you (at least not right now).</p> 

		<h2>Figure out your motivation</h2>

		<p>My motivation was that 7-year old me beat all the boys at math tests and 19-year old me dropped out of Linear Algebra because there were no other women in the room. My motivation was that 85% of software engineers are men and it made me mad. My motivation was that I knew I could be successful in this field, and if I could do it then I could help other underrepresented people do it too. My motivation was that I had a bet with an ex-boyfriend about which one of us would be the first to earn $100k in one year.</p>

		<p><b>Those motivations <i>still</i> get me out of bed in the morning.</b> (Well, except the $100k bet. That one's settled.)</p>

		<p>What's your motivation? It can't be "I don't know, it sounds cool." It can't be money alone (although the money is good). What is going to get you out of bed to keep beating your head against this thing for weeks and months and years?</p>


		<h2>Selecting a bootcamp</h2>


		<p>When it comes to selecting a bootcamp, look for programs that have a long track record of success and that publish data about "placement as software engineer" (not just "placement in tech role," which could mean anything).</p>

		<p><a href="https://flatironschool.com/" target="blank">Flatiron</a> and <a href="https://www.fullstackacademy.com/" target="blank">Fullstack</a> are both highly regarded. Fullstack offers a "women+" program called <a href="https://www.gracehopper.com/" target="blank">Grace Hopper</a>. Flatiron and Fullstack both charge a tuition fee in the $15-$20k range, which isn't cheap. Both offer loan/installment payment options. If you decide to take on debt to pursue becoming a software engineer, think about how you'll pay back that debt if you don't wind up with a job as software engineer in the end.</p>

		<p>You'll get more for your money if you go in prepared. Don't skip the free online courses before applying.</p>

		<p>The bootcamp I attended, <a href="https://adadevelopersacademy.org" target="blank">Ada Developers Academy</a>, is tuition-free and specifically targets Black, Latine, Indigenous American, Native Hawaiian, LGBTQIA+ women and gender expansive adults (the applicant requirements were different back in 2015; I wouldn't qualify today). Tuition-free programs are obviously incredibly competitive to get into but are a great option for people who meet the demographic requirements.</p> 


		<h2>Prepare to hustle</h2>

		<p>No matter which bootcamp you attend, expect to hustle <i>hard</i> to get your first full-time role. Expect your first two to three years in industry to be really hard. You're basically earning your college degree on the job while working full time; that's how my first three years felt, anyway. Prepare for the <b>"trough of sorrow"</b> where you question every choice you've ever made in life.</p>

		<p><b>You can do it.</b> It just helps to go in knowing that it won't be a piece of cake.</p>

		<h2>Compensation</h2>

		<p>In my experience, the <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/" target="blank">levels.fyi</a> data is very accurate. My last batch of interns signed offers at $175k first year total comp (FYTC), and this was before the big 2022 Amazon comp adjustment. FYTC numbers at the other FAANG companies are similar. <b>Like I said, the money is good.</b></p>

		<p>Smaller companies generally can't afford to pay salaries that high. I would expect to FYTC at a smaller tech company to be in the $100/$120k range, depending on the market.</p>
